Please read the files (especially INSTALL.asciidoc, README.Makefiles) in the
husky-common-package "huskybse" FIRST! If you don't have this package you
should grab it:

git clone https://github.com/huskyproject/huskybse.git

Or you may read it on GitHub: https://github.com/huskyproject/huskybse

0. the smapi and the fidoconfig package is required for sqPack.

1. Put sqPack in the directory where the other packages of fido
   linux reside:

   /usr/src/packages/        -> smapi/
                             -> fidoconfig/
			     -> sqpack/

2. Determine which makefile you need to use then compile and install fidoconfig
   using selected makefile, as following examples:
   Ex.1 (use platfom-specific makefile):
	$ make -f makefile.lnx
	$ make -f makefile.lnx install
   Ex.2 (use common makefile and ../huskymak.cfg):
	$ make
	$ make install

You're ready. If you have a working fidoconfig, you can now purge MsgBases under
unix.
